Rules of thumb
- id are unique across the page
- for simplicity field.id and field.name should match
- use the ajax validator as last validator in the list
- use lower cases for input.type
- don't use spaces or special chars in id and names
- use only one ajax validator per field!
- json services should live on the same server (or you will get into security issues)
- in a perfectc RESTful world, http GET is to READ data, http POST is to WRITE data
